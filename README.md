# About

A website built to explore and implement the concepts of microservices architecture! While the UI/UX is kept very basic, the primary focus was on learning and applying core principles of scalability, separation of concerns, and cross-service communication.

## Technologies Used:

*Backend:* Developed using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to ensure modular and scalable design.<br>
*Frontend:* Built with **React.js**, keeping it minimal to focus on functionality.<br>
*Deployment:* Each microservice is deployed in **Docker** containers and orchestrated by **Kubernetes** for seamless scalability.<br>
*Communication:* Enabled asynchronous *cross-service communication* via an *event bus*.<br>

## Tools and Workflow:

Used **Chocolatey** as the package manager for an efficient setup.<br>
Leveraged **Skaffold** for smooth development and deployment workflows.<br>
