A website built to explore and implement the concepts of microservices architecture! While the UI/UX is kept very basic, the primary focus was on learning and applying core principles of scalability, separation of concerns, and cross-service communication.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Developed using Node.js and Express.js to ensure modular and scalable design.
Frontend: Built with React.js, keeping it minimal to focus on functionality.
Deployment: Each microservice is deployed in Docker containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes for seamless scalability.
Communication: Enabled asynchronous cross-service communication via an event bus.
Tools and Workflow:

Used Chocolatey as the package manager for an efficient setup.
Leveraged Skaffold for smooth development and deployment workflows.
This project served as a hands-on journey into modern web application architecture and taught me the importance of microservices, containerization, and orchestration. While the UI/UX is simple, the backend architecture is where the magic happens!
